  <h2>So,What is an Acrylic paint?</h2>
  <p>Acrylic paint is a fast-drying paint made of pigment suspended in acrylic polymer emulsion. 
  Acrylic paints are water-soluble, but become water-resistant when dry. </p><br>
  <p>Depending on how much the paint is diluted with water, or modified with acrylic gels, mediums, or pastes, 
  the finished acrylic painting can resemble a watercolor or an oil painting, or have its own unique characteristics not attainable with other media.
  Acrylic paint is typically used for crafting, or in art classes in schools because it does not require any chemicals, and rinses away with just water.
  It also is less likely to leave a stain on clothes than oil paint.</p>

  <h2>How to paint with Acrylics?</h2>
  
  <p>Acrylic painters can modify the appearance, hardness, flexibility, texture, and other characteristics of 
  the paint surface by using acrylic mediums or simply by adding water. Watercolor and oil painters also use various mediums, but the 
  range of acrylic mediums is much greater. </p><br>
  <p>
  Acrylics have the ability to bond to many different surfaces, and mediums can be used to modify 
  their binding characteristics. Acrylics can be used on paper, canvas and a range of other materials, however their use on engineered woods
  such as medium-density fiberboard can be problematic because of the porous nature of those surfaces. </p><br>
 <p>In these cases it is recommended that the surface first be sealed with an appropriate sealer. Acrylics can be applied in thin layers or washes to create effects that resemble
  watercolors and other water-based mediums. . Acrylic paints are also used in hobbies such as train, car, house, and human models. Wet acrylic paint is easily removed from 
  paint brushes and skin with water, whereas oil paints require the use of a hydrocarbon.

 Acrylics easily scrape or peel from a surface.</p>
